 * Children's day On children's day, a teacher wants to distribute candies to all her students. 
 * She has N candies, and each candy has a special value. 
 * She wants all candies to have the same special value so she decides to reduce the special values of some candies. 
 * However, the special values of all the candies cannot be reduced. 
 * Hence, she decides to reduce the special values for as much candies as 
 * possible so that at least K candies have the same special value and this value
 *  must be as large as possible. 
 *  Find the maximum value that the teacher can achieve 
 *  
 *  Input Specification: 
 *  input1: N, total number of candies 
 *  input2: K, candies having the same special value

 *   input2: 2 
 *   input3: (26,20,23} 
 *   Output: 23 
 *   
 *   Explanation: Here, the teacher can reduce the special value of the first candy to 23 and thus, 
 *   at least two candies will have the special value of 23. Explanation: Here,
